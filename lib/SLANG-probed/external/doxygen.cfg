# If the CALL_GRAPH and HAVE_DOT options are set to YES then

# for selected functions only using the \callgraph command.

CALL_GRAPH             = YES

# If the CALLER_GRAPH and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then

# If the DIRECTORY_GRAPH, SHOW_DIRECTORIES and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES
# then doxygen will show the dependencies a directory has on other directories
# in a graphical way. The dependency relations are determined by the #include
# relations between the files in the directories.

# The DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT tag can be used to set the image format of the images
# generated by dot. Possible values are png, jpg, or gif

# The DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES tag can be used to set the maximum number of
# nodes that will be shown in the graph. If the number of nodes in a graph
# becomes larger than this value, doxygen will truncate the graph, which is
# visualized by representing a node as a red box. Note that doxygen if the
# number of direct children of the root node in a graph is already larger than
# DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES then the graph will not be shown at all. Also note
# that the size of a graph can be further restricted by MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH.

# The MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH tag can be used to set the maximum depth of the
# graphs generated by dot. A depth value of 3 means that only nodes reachable
# from the root by following a path via at most 3 edges will be shown. Nodes
# that lay further from the root node will be omitted. Note that setting this
# option to 1 or 2 may greatly reduce the computation time needed for large
# code bases. Also note that the size of a graph can be further restricted by
# DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES. Using a depth of 0 means no depth restriction.

# Set the DOT_TRANSPARENT tag to YES to generate images with a transparent
# background. This is disabled by default, because dot on Windows does not
# seem to support this out of the box. Warning: Depending on the platform used,

# a graph (i.e. they become hard to read).

DOT_TRANSPARENT        = NO

# Set the DOT_MULTI_TARGETS tag to YES allow dot to generate multiple output
# files in one run (i.e. multiple -o and -T options on the command line). This

# support this, this feature is disabled by default.
